## Description
Hi this website was created with the intent of completing On The Job Checkpoint 1.
I chose to make a website for my lovely wife and her side business, might as well use the skills
leaned in the course, right???
Here is what grading criteria I am to adhere to as I build the first part:

### Creating our Website's Foundation 

In this section, you will create the basic foundation of a webpage using essential HTML tags. This exercise will help you understand the structure of a webpage and how to organize content using basic HTML elements.

#### Deliverables 

- [ ] Create a new directory and index.html file. 
- [ ] Set up a new GitHub repository for your project. (This repository here is not your starter code)
- [ ] Initialize your local project directory and connect it to the newly created GitHub repository.
- [ ] Set up a basic HTML boilerplate for your project.
- [ ] Create a navigation bar representing the different sections of the website.
- [ ] Create a header section for the client's name.
- [ ] Create paragraph sections describing who the client is, what they do, etc.
- [ ] Create a directory for assets (images, videos, etc).
- [ ] Create a gallery of images/videos for your project.
- [ ] A "Contact Us" form should also be included.
- [ ] Add a footer section for your project as well. 
- [ ] Use Git to `add`, `commit`, and `push` your changes to the repository for your project.

We always have the option to look at the solution code [here](https://github.com/HackerUSA-CE/aisd-wde-on-the-job-1/tree/solution), but what is the point?? No pain, no gain!
